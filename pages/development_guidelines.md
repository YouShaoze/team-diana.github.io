#Development guidelines 

## New git repos
* If it's a repo containing code for a specified rover put the rover name before the repo name (T0R0-Arm_driver)
* If it's a general repo use a useful name
* **Remember the Readme.md file**, it's very useful for other team members
+ If your repo contain software to be delivered on a rover a travis build is needed to test it befor the upload on the rover.
