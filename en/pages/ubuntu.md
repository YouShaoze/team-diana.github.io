# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is the first distro offically supported by ROS. All the tutorials on the wiki are made using Ubuntu so it is pretty ease to use it.

However Ubuntu does not update its packages really often, so many libraries, compilers and tools can be old and missing some interesting features.

## Team Diana repo

[repo-scripts](https://github.com/team-diana/repo-scripts) provides scripts that can be used to build the missing libraries, such as Boost. A ready-to-use repo is also provided, see the README.md

## Libraries and Tools

  * clang ppa http://llvm.org/apt/
  * gcc ppa https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test

## Virtual Machine

For most task it is also possible to run ubuntu inside a VM. 
See [Ubuntu - VM](ubuntu_vm.md)
