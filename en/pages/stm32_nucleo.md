[Nucleo STM32](http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/stm32-nucleo.html) boards are ideal for prototyping for many embedded applications. They are like (and compatible) arduino boards, but they are cheap and faster (since they come equipped with STM32 ARM processors instead of AVR)

It is possible to use them without libraries, or with many rtos such as chibos and ARM's mbed.

Currently, the team has these board at its disposal:

- 1 NUCLEO-L476RG
- 1 NUCLEO-
- 1 NUCLEO-

## mbed
