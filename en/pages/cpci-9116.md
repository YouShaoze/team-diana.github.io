## API

Here follows some notes about the api. For further reference see the [PCI DASK manual](http://www.adlinktech.com/publications/manual/Software/PCIS-DASK-X/PSDASKFR.pdf)

```c++

// Write a single bit at Line [0-7] of port Port 0 (cPCI9116 has only one port)
I16 DO_WriteLine (U16 CardNumber, U16 Port, U16 Line, 
U16 State);

```

## Drivers

It may be possible that ADLink still does not publish linux 3.x drivers. In this case, email adlink and request the source code (better option anyway). Off course we already have the source so ask to other team members for a copy.
