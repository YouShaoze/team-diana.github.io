Polulu 3-axis accelerometer

**from polulu.com:**

**This tiny triple-axis accelerometer is a basic carrier board for the Freescale MMA7361LC XYZ-axis accelerometer, a great low-g sensor with analog voltage outputs, adjustable sensitivity (±1.5 g or ±6 g), and a 0g-detect digital output that signals when the board is in free-fall. Our breakout board has the form factor of a 10-pin DIP package, which makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1″ perfboards, and the unit is smaller than competing products, all at a lower price. The board operates from 2.2 to 3.6 V.**
