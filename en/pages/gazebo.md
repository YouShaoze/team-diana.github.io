# Gazebo 

[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) is a robot simulation software, built upon [ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/) and integrated with [ROS](ROS.md).

## Tips

- Use always the **ODE** physics engine. 
  Currently this is the only engine that supports force and torque feedback for joints.

- Use the **--verbose** switch. 
  Most warnings are hidden by default. Use the **--verbose** switch when you cannot find an error or something unexpected happens.
