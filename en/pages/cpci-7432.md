The cPCI-7432 card is wired to the following components:

- Rangefinders
- Active suspension accelerometers


Here follows some notes about the api. For further reference see the [PCI DASK manual](http://www.adlinktech.com/publications/manual/Software/PCIS-DASK-X/PSDASKFR.pdf)

```c++

// Read a single channel at port i [0-63]
// voltageRange is a value like AD_B_0_5_V (bipolar 5V) 
AI_ReadChannel(adcCard, i, voltageRanges, &value))

```

## Drivers

It may be possible that ADLink still does not publish linux 3.x drivers. In this case, email adlink and request the source code (better option anyway). Off course we already have the source so ask to other team members for a copy.
